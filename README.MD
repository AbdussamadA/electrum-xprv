This tool lets you generate extended private keys and extended public keys in various 
formats for use with Electrum. It also lets you derive xpubs and child xprvs from parent 
xprvs. It's designed so that you can pipe the output to electrum and directly create 
wallets with it. Run it with `python3 xprv.py -h` to see the options.
